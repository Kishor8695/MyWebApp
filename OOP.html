    <h1> Introduction to OOPs Concepts </h1>
    <p>
        Object-oriented programming has four basic concepts:
        encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
        Even if these concepts seem incredibly complex, understanding the general framework
        of how they work will help you understand the basics of an OOP computer program

        Polymorphism
        <br />
        If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.

        In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

        Another example can be to speak something; for example, a cat speaks meow, dog barks woof, etc.
